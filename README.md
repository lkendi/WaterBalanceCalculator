# Water Balance Calculator

## Overview

The Water Balance Calculator is a desktop application designed for water quality analysis. It enables users to input water sample parameters, calculate missing values based on ionic balance principles, and compare results against recommended standards. The application provides a clear visual representation of water balance calculations with immediate feedback.

## Key Features

-   **Comprehensive Parameter Input**: Enter values for major cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺), anions (Cl⁻, F⁻, NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻), alkalinity, and conductivity
-   **Intelligent Calculation**: Automatically calculates any single missing parameter based on ionic balance    
-   **Standards Comparison**: Built-in reference table with KEBS water quality standards
-   **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with professional typography and visual design
    

## Technical Implementation

-  Built with **.NET 6 (C#)** and **Avalonia UI** for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Usage

1.  Enter known water parameter values in the input fields
2.  Leave one field blank to calculate its value
3.  Click "CALCULATE" to perform the water balance analysis
4.  Review results in the analysis panel
5.  Compare values against recommended standards
6.  Use "CLEAR ALL" to reset the form
